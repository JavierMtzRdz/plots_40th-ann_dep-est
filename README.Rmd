## Art Statement

This logo has been designed to represent the main research areas of the Department of Statistics. The state diagram of a Markov chain located on the top left symbolizes Bayesian Statistics; the functions on the top, Robust Statistics; the lines in the background, Statistical Learning, Multivariate analysis, and Time Series; the area plot at the bottom, Environmental and Spatial Statistics; the dots in the background, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics (it is a Manhattan chart with polar coordinates). Finally, the bar plot on the number “0” represents other research areas in the department. Together, these elements depict the view from UBC to the Coast Mountains, where the area plot at the bottom represents the mountains and the other elements represent the sky. It’s worth noting All the plots were created using R and the codes are available here.
